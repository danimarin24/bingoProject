<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project has been created by the student Daniel Marín Bocanegra in a project for DAM/DMA (Development of Multiplatform Applications).

The project consisted of creating the famous video game 'bingo', a very popular game here in Spain.

In the following sections I will detail what points I had to complete in order to get this project done, and I will also include my grade at the end so you can see a complete evaluation.


### Built With

This project was created with native Java language, without frameworks. Using only the official Java documentation below.

It has been created completely from scratch, with the creation of different methods to make a cleaner and visual code, while modular and scalable.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
- [x] Add a method to ask the number of cartons to play. [not specified]
- [x] Add an array with 3 rows and 9 columns x bingo card. [not specified]
- [x] Add a method to fill all the rows with 4 zeros randomly. [not specified]
- [x] Add a method to print bingo cards into the terminal. [1.5 points]
- [x] Add a method to draw balls from 1 to 90, and check if that number (ball) is in any of the cards, if so, put a dash. [1.5 points]
- [x] Add a method to check if the cards have a bingo, and print it by terminal. Also, print all the numbers that have been coming up. [1 point]

- [x] Improvements [TOTAL: 5 extra points]
  - [x] Replace randomly generated zeros by a '@'. [0.5 points]
